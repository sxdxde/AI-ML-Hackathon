# Electricity Bill Prediction & Analysis

This project predicts electricity bills based on appliance usage, city, and time of the year, and provides detailed analysis using interactive visualizations.

## 📍 Interactive Geographical Visualizations

To generate interactive geographical plots (such as choropleth maps by city or region), the notebook requires a **GeoJSON file** that contains geographical boundary definitions.

### 📂 Required File

- `state_india.geojson`

### 📌 How to Use

Before running the interactive map cells in the notebook:

1. **Download** or **locate** your GeoJSON file.
2. **Upload** or **attach** the GeoJSON file to your Jupyter notebook session.
3. Ensure the file name in the code matches the uploaded file name. For example:
